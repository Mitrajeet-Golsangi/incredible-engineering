## Core Concept

This application is a teaching learning based platform for students where the students can teach and explain concepts to other students

## Introduction

This project is known as “INCREDIBLE ENGINEERING”, where a student can play the role of the teacher and student at a time.
Let’s assume a scenario,
Suppose a student in a class on 60 gets the concept that exactly the teacher was telling the entire class. In this case, there are 2 possibilities, 1st, one can ask a doubt to the teacher, and the teacher will tell him the solution of the same in an appropriate way, but this approach is very time-consuming.
2nd is if there are shy persons in the class they will never ask doubts and their stack will be once again pushed by the 1 doubt.
So the ultimate solution to this situation is to create one platform where that one student can teach other students by giving his time.
Then the question arises, what he will get after doing this?
After all, he is investing his time in this situation.
So the answer to this is we’ll give him stars accordingly. The star pattern and number of stars are decided accordingly.
And the greater the no of stars, the greater will be the Reputation and, in future there are chances that he will get paid by doing all this

## Features

### Home

The home interface for teacher will be like (tentative) this there will be one nav bar on teachers page the bar contains home upload and req’s section.
